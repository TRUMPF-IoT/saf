The Smart Application Framework (SAF) is an open-source and cross-plattform framework for building distributed applications across cloud and edge. It allows developers to build resilient, stateless and stateful plug-ins that run on cloud and edge.

SAF runs on [.NET Core](https://dotnet) and can easily be integrated into [ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core) applications. It utilizes Microsoft's .NET Core [Dependency Injection](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection) to provide a main DI container that loads various plug-ins. At its base, it provides exchangeable messaging and storage infrastructure as well as a logging interface.
